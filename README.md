#  Implementation and Analysis of the Fast Fourier Transform

My final year BSc Mathematics project is to explain the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm, create an implementation in code, and test it.

The FFT is an algorithm with many applications in modern technology, including GPS, wireless signals, signal processing. Mathematically, the algorithm can be used to efficiently multiply two polynomials by converting between its coefficient and value representations, using roots of unity. The FFT has its origins in Fourier Analysis, where it is known as optimal method for calculating the Discrete Fourier Transform for a set of points.
